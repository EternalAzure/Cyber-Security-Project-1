# Cyber Security Project 1

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures

### Person pages
Pages are accessible without login via url. <br>
Pages are easy to iterate because they are numbered sequentially. <br>
This enables automated data collection. <br>

### Register and Login
User creation uses md5 hashing for passwords which has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities.

### HTTP
HTTP does not encrypt data and thus attacker can monitor network traffic
